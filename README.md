# Neural_Style_Transfer
An implementation of neural style transfer, the basic iterative approach and a more advanced approach using AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization). The AdaIN implementation done here takes lots of inspiration (and knowledge and code) from [the unoffocial pytorch implementation of the paper](https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-AdaIN/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file).

To run the iterative approach, just run the python file on the terminal and provide the FULL path_name of the content and style images you want passed to the model.
