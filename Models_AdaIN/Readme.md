The Various models available.

vgg_normalised.pth is the pre-trained vgg-19 model used in the implementation.

decoder.pth is the pre-trained model provided by the [AdaIN paper](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style/tree/master) authors, whose original code is in Lua.

1600, 5000, 10000, 15000, 16000 iter files are trained by me on Kaggle. They work, but not nearly as well the pre-trained one or the 160000 iter one, which was provided by the [unoffical pytorch implementation](https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-AdaIN/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file).
